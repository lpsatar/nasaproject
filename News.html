              The Sun is the star at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything — from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris — in its orbit.
Earth
Earth – our home planet – is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest planet. It's the only place we know of inhabited by living things.

 The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.

            <p class="text-center fw-bold">What is a solar flare?
              
              </p>
            <p class="text-center">A solar flare is a release of electromagnetic energy from the sun in the form of light and X-rays. The X-rays and gamma rays reach the Earth in about 8-minutes and can cause disruptions to radio communications. These events are typically short-lived, lasting about 1/2 hour. Long duration flares can last for more than 3 hours.</p>

            <p class="text-center fw-bold">What is aurora?</p>
            <p class="text-center">The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are beautiful lights in the sky seen in northern countries. They occur during geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles from the sun. When these particles hit Earth’s magnetic field, they create colors like green, purple, and red in the atmosphere. You can see the Northern Lights in places near the North Pole, like Norway and Canada.

            <p class="text-center fw-bold">What is outer core?</p>
            <p class="text-center">Earth's magnetic field is created by the movement of molten iron and nickel in its outer core. This movement generates electric currents, which produce magnetic forces. The magnetic field protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps animals navigate. It plays a crucial role in keeping our environment safe.</p>

            <p class="text-center fw-bold">How long can a geomagnetic storm last?</p>
            <p class="text-center">Geomagnetic storms can last from a few hours to several days. The duration depends on the strength of the solar wind and how it interacts with Earth's magnetic field. Strong storms may last longer and can cause beautiful displays of the Northern Lights. These storms are closely monitored by scientists.</p>

            <p class="text-center">NASA is the main space agency that monitors solar activity and predicts geomagnetic storms. They use satellites to observe the sun and gather data. By studying solar flares and solar wind, NASA helps protect satellites and power systems on Earth. This information is important for keeping our technology safe.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Space weather forecasts from Natural Resources Canada help people prepare for geomagnetic storms. Companies can make their systems stronger, and individuals can create emergency plans and kits. The Sun has an eleven-year cycle, with more storms during solar maximum, expected around 2025. During solar minimum, the Sun is quieter.</p>
